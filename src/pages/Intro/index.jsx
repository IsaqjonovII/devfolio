          Hey there! Ilhomjon here, living and coding in the vibrant city of
          Tashkent, Uzbekistan. I'm a web developer with a passion for crafting

          journey with youâ€”let's create some digital magic together!
        </h3>
        <h3 className={c.intro__text}>
          I've been working as a frontend developer for over 2 years. During
          this time, I've had the privilege of contributing to impactful
          projects where I honed my skills in TypeScript, Javascript, React,
          Nodejs and Fastify.
        </h3>
        <h3 className={c.intro__text}>
          These days, I focus on working on my side project Motoshop.uz where
          people can buy or sell their bikes.
        </h3>
        <h3 className={c.intro__text}>
          I take pleasure in transforming intricate challenges into elegant
          solutions through code. My interest in web development arises from a
          goal to design not only visually appealing websites but also ensure a
          smooth user experience.
        </h3>
        <h3 className={c.intro__text}>
          In the future, I aim to enhance my proficiency in frontend development
          and explore other IT domains like AI, Cybersecurity, and Mobile
          development. I am dedicated to staying updated on industry trends and
          consistently improving my skills.
        </h3>
        <h3 className={c.intro__text}>
          Beyond coding, I find joy in the roar of a motorbike and the thrill of
          travel. Join me as I navigate both the digital and physical landscapes
          with equal enthusiasm!
